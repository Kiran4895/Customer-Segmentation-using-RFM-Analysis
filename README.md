# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis in order to understand the value derived from each customer. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).
Data:
The dataset used for this project is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company. The dataset includes the following variables:
•	Invoice No: Invoice number. Nominal, a six-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation
•	Stock Code: Product (item) code. Nominal, a five-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product
•	Description: Product (item) name. Nominal
•	Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric
•	Invoice Date: Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated
•	Unit Price: Unit price. Numeric, product price per unit in sterling
•	Customer ID: Customer number. Nominal, a six-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer
•	Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides
